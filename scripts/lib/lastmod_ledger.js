/**
 * Per-URL lastmod ledger: a freshness date that survives a shallow clone.
 *
 * Mirrors scripts/lib/lastmod_ledger.js in p-n-p and WPP-llm so the four repos
 * that already carry per-URL freshness and the two that did not now derive the
 * date the same way. Kept deliberately identical rather than re-specialised:
 * the failure this guards against is subtle, and a divergent copy is how one
 * repo quietly loses the guard.
 *
 * What it replaces here. scripts/build/write_sitemaps.js emitted
 * `<url><loc>...</loc></url>` with no <lastmod> at all - 0 of 560 URLs carried
 * one, on the live sitemap as well as the built one. data/cadence/policy.json
 * treats a missing lastmod as a blocking no_freshness_signal, and it leaves a
 * crawler no way to tell what changed. Recency is the strongest single
 * correlate of whether an answer engine cites a page.
 *
 * The obvious fix - `git log -1 --format=%cs -- <file>` at build time - is the
 * right idea, because the date should follow content rather than build time.
 * But it depends on the checkout having the history for each file, and CI
 * checkouts usually do not: actions/checkout defaults to depth 1, where every
 * file's "last commit" is the single commit present, so every URL gets the CI
 * run's date. That uniform date-bump is worse than no date, and it is exactly
 * what scripts/cadence_gate.js flags as uniform_lastmod. This repo makes that
 * trap easy to fall into: several workflows check out at the default depth.
 *
 * How this fixes it. The ledger stores {url: {hash, lastmod}} in
 * data/cadence/lastmod_ledger.json, beside the known_urls.json the cadence gate
 * already keeps, and follows that file's conventions rather than adding a
 * parallel system. The hash is taken over the rendered page, so a URL whose
 * content is unchanged keeps the date it already had no matter how the repo was
 * checked out, and only genuinely changed content advances. Git history is
 * still used, but only to seed a URL the ledger has never seen, and only when
 * the clone actually has the history to answer the question. No date is ever
 * reconstructed, estimated, or inferred.
